# IX-Joey Modular Knowledge System Documentation

## Overview

IX-Joey’s architecture introduces a modular knowledge swapping system designed to dynamically load, unload, and integrate discrete knowledge blocks on demand. This approach allows Joey to handle multiple domains flexibly without bloated memory usage.

## Components

- **Block Manager:** Manages loading, unloading, and querying of knowledge blocks.
- **Context Switcher:** Detects user context changes to activate/deactivate relevant blocks.
- **Block Storage:** Persistent storage and versioning of knowledge blocks.
- **Integration Engine:** Harmonizes results from multiple blocks to produce coherent answers.
- **Latency Cache:** Optimizes performance with recent query caching.
- **Update Manager:** Safely updates blocks with backup and rollback support.
- **Memory Adapter:** Tags memory sessions with active knowledge context.
- **Interface:** CLI updated for dynamic modularity and enriched responses.

## Design Rationale

- **Dynamic modularity:** Mimics human cognitive flexibility by loading domain expertise as needed.
- **Scalability:** Reduces active memory requirements by offloading inactive knowledge.
- **Transparency:** Modular blocks are JSON files, fully inspectable and editable.
- **Extensibility:** New domains can be added by creating new knowledge blocks and updating context maps.
- **Safety:** Updates are versioned and rollback-capable.

## Future Directions

- Integration with neural-symbolic hybrids.
- Automated block generation from corpora.
- Real-time online learning and update pipelines.
- Multi-modal knowledge blocks (images, audio).
