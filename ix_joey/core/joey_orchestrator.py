"""
IX-Joey Updated Core Orchestrator for Modular Sibling Integration

Refactored to serve as a generalist sibling AI compatible with IX-Gibson.
Handles queries with improved modular knowledge and prepares for
interaction with Gibson as the main orchestrator.

Features:
- Modular query processing with placeholder hooks for domain-specific extensions
- Context-aware response building
- Designed to run independently as well as integrate under Gibson orchestration
